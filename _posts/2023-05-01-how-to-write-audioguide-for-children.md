Children perceive the world differently than we adults do. They have different interests, bring along different prior knowledge, have a different understanding of what is exciting and important, and depending on their age, they also learn differently than we do. That's why it's important to prepare information differently for children than for adults.

This is especially important when creating an audio guide for children - a product that must convey a lot of information to children in a short amount of time. The more the special needs of children are taken into account, the more information they will take away from their visit to the exhibition.

# The desire to have an audio guide for children

It often goes like this: a museum already has an audio guide for adults and now wants to expand its exhibition with a product for children. The existing audio guide has a certain number of stations, usually one station on each topic with a high information density spread over a few minutes. If an audio guide for children is now to be created, it is not advisable to simply take the same stations, shrink the information a bit and have it read in by a narrator with a storyteller's voice. Rather, the audioguide should be rethought from the ground up.

# Everything starts with the choice of content

Even the selection of topics is crucial. Children are often interested in different things than adults, which means that in the same exhibition, other exhibits may attract their attention much more. Then, once a selection of stations has been made to include in the audio guide, take a close look at each one and ask yourself: what would have interested me most about it as a child?

Even if you select the same station for children and adults, completely different information around the same topic may be of interest to each audience. Adults, for example, might be interested in the context of the political situation at the time, dates, and important personalities; children might be more intrigued by unusual numbers and sizes and personal fates. They also bring a very different background knowledge than adults. Think about which aspects the children might know from their own lives and tie in with them.

But be careful: not all children are the same. Preschoolers, for example, have a completely different level of knowledge than 13-year-olds, and their interests and perceptiveness also differ greatly. Therefore, it should be clearly defined which age group is to be addressed by the audio guide. In order to make it available to as many children as possible, it is a good idea to set the target group age between eight and twelve. Once you have decided on an age range, consider whether you know a child of that age and use this as a guide for all the steps that will be taken in the audio guide production.

# The framework that holds everything together

Once the stations and topics have been roughly determined, think about a framework for your audio guide. First of all, it should be clarified whether the stations are to function independently of one another or whether they are to be listened to in a specific order. Then there is the question of who the children will be listening to in the audio guide. It is obvious, for example, to think of one or more characters who have some kind of thematic connection to the exhibition. They introduce themselves to the children at the beginning of the audio guide and then guide them through the museum.

This can happen either in the present in the real exhibition space or, for example, in the form of a story in which the children are taken back in time to the place and time of the event. You can also provide the audio guide tour with a riddle that leads the children from station to station and can only be solved at the end. There are endless possibilities for how such a framework can be laid out. The main thing is that the children feel picked up by the audioguide from the beginning, that their curiosity is aroused and that they feel like taking the tour of the exhibition.

# When it comes to information density, less is often more

Just as with audio guides for adults, the length of the finished audio stations should be no more than two minutes. This brings with it the challenge of keeping the texts per audio station concise and yet including all the information that is important to you.

Keep the information to a minimum and present it in a way that is clear and, above all, interesting for the children. Fill in the gaps between the information with something funny, let the characters of your audio guide occasionally fool around and incorporate the information into the story in a playful way. Because pure information transfer over many listening stations, as it is usually done with audio guides for adults, can quickly overwhelm or bore the children, so that they can no longer properly absorb what is being said or even switch off completely.

# The texts are made for listening

Once the audio guide has been roughly planned, it is possible to start developing the text scripts that will later be set to music. When writing the texts, keep in mind that they will not be read later but heard in the audio guide. And writing for listening differs significantly from writing for reading, because what is heard is more fleeting and must therefore be much more precise than written language. If the listeners are also children, this is especially important.

This means: use simple and descriptive language with a simple sentence structure and without long nested sentences, formulate actively with many verbs instead of nouns and use repetitions gladly. For each point, ask yourself: how would I explain this to someone orally? It helps to actually talk out loud to yourself and write down what you say. And if technical words or large numbers can't be avoided, explain them.

# The setting as the heart of the audio guide for children

Finally comes the most important part of the whole thing: the soundtrack. By means of voices, sounds and music, the audio guide for kids comes to life. This is what the children will hear in the end, so you should put extra love into the audio design.

Come up with distinctive voices for your characters, and choose great voice actors to portray them. Also, work with professional sound designers who can set the spoken word in context. Sound design can be minimal - the clatter of hooves here, the chirping of birds there, or the echoing sound of a basement vault - but it's hugely important in helping kids get into the story. It also makes the audio more interesting to listen to. Music can also take the listener back in time, or make the work of the artists the story is about more tangible.

# Basic principles that you should always follow

In the end, how the audio guide for children is designed depends on the creativity of the makers. But some basic principles should always be followed: take the children seriously! Meet them with everything that is said and how it is said at eye level and do not lecture them from above. Confide in the children. Even difficult topics should not be withheld from them, but should be conveyed with appropriate caution. Always start from the children's perspective. Think about what questions children would ask, what they already know, and what they might find particularly funny or exciting.

The more child-friendly the audio guide is designed and the more the children feel picked up by it, the more they will listen, understand and remember it in the long term.
