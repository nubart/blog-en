Have you ever wondered why the flight attendant who welcomes you onto the airplane always keeps one hand behind her back? 

It’s not only a polite gesture. The flight attendant isn’t just greeting you, she’s also counting you. In her hand, she’s holding a passenger counter like this one:

People often discuss how difficult it is to interpret data. But, the other, perhaps bigger struggle, is obtaining data in the first place. As you can see, even with the cutting edge technology airplanes have today, getting a simple passenger count requires yet another creative device. 

The same is true for museums. Before you can win relevant insights into your audience, you need to find an ideal and discrete tool to get data.

## The struggle to get visitor data

In the museum, the easiest data to obtain is probably the number of visitors, but anything else becomes complicated. When a ticket is sold, many museums ask their visitors where they’re from or for a postal code. But this may not only be an annoyance to visitors, it also adds a complication for the reception personnel. The staff, in addition to giving change or explaining something to the visitor, must also take down the data. What seemed simple can easily become complicated during peak hours.

But, what’s worse, this method doesn’t capture some of the most important data for a museum director: Where are the visitors from? How long do they stay in the museum? How did they like the exhibits? What displays did they find most interesting?

## Nubart is also a tool for capturing visitor data
While airlines disguise their effort to collect data as a welcome greeting, Nubart offers an audio guide.

Indeed. All of Nubart's audio guides, whether you prefer the card format or a digital only option, serve as valuable mechanism for collecting important data for your museum. They are, to put it this way, your flight attendant. And all of this is achieved in an automated fashion without distracting your staff or bothering the visitor. 

To access the multilingual and multimedia content of Nubart’s audio guides, the visitor uses their own Smartphone (which in technology jargon is called BYOD or “bring your own device”). This way, our system can capture very valuable data anonymously, without infringing on any of the Data Protection laws. There’s no way we can reach the identity, numbers or accounts of the user through our audio guides. We can, however, find out the **country of origin of the visitor** and their preferred language, which are fundamentally important when focusing the marketing of the museum. Today, some traditional audio guides (in other words, the devices) also allow museums to capture usage-data, but they can’t determine the country of origin: that information can only be obtained by asking the visitor directly or, of course, by capturing that information automatically through their smartphone like we do at Nubart.

We’ve also included some behavioral data requiring complex algorithms to obtain to our statistical reports that we provide to the museums and exhibition centers we work with. For example: we track the total duration of audio use for each user or visit and the approximate amount of time visitors spend in the installations.

Finally, we offer a list of **the most played tracks** and their respective percentages, offering surprising insights into the displays that really interested visitors. Because the visitor’s time in the museum is limited, normally people just click on the audio files of the exhibits that have interested them the most. We know by experience that this dataset doesn’t always coincide with what the curator of an exhibit wants or expects. Once this information has been gained, the museum can decide to strengthen or expand upon the public’s favorite exhibits, attracting more visitors, or to look for new ways to attract the audience’s interest to exhibits that may deserve more attention in the curator’s opinion.

## How to find out what visitors think of your museum

We can also capture data in one of the most relevant moments of a museum visit, which is the end of the visit. At this time, the visitor will have formed an impression about the exhibits. They have that impression fresh in their memory, and an emotion of either enthusiasm or disappointment associated with it

It would be the ideal moment for the museum to discover what aspects could be improved upon. But, how can this be done? By placing staff with a microphone and a notepad to interview visitors right at the moment when they’re tired and impatient after spending several hours on their feet? And although this could be done, what would stop this information from being biased? The majority of visitors will feel a bit uncomfortable giving criticisms to a staff member at the museum they’ve just visited.

 We’ve also solved that problem thanks to the **brief feedback survey at the end of Nubart audio guides**. The visitor finds it at the end of the digital content, at a moment when they’ve also reached the end of the visit. The survey is immediately available, visitors won’t be sent to any external page. It can be responded in a few seconds right there in the museum or on the train ride back to their hotel, or in the museum cafeteria. The survey is anonymous and not done in person, meaning that the visitor won’t feel intimidated or worried about expressing themselves freely. The best part of all: the museum receives these comments via email in real time, allowing you to take the pulse of your exhibitions all the time.
 
 Here are some of the comments that visitors have left through our audio guides::

If the museum would like to ask the visitor’s age, gender or other data that cannot be automated, this is the moment to do it! The museum can **personalize the questions on our feedback survey** to meet their own unique needs. 

The data Nubart registers automatically as well as the information given voluntarily by visitors are included in our packages, which also include the production of content (translation and audio file creation). You can find more information about our rates [on our website.](http://www.nubart.eu/#pricing){:target="_blank"} 

It’s possible that, as a museum, you don’t feel the need to offer an audio guide to your visitors. But, wouldn’t you like to know more about them? In that case, do as the airlines do and welcome your visitors with a Nubart audio guide at the door of *your airplane!*
